Measured a 10cm length of 22AWG wire.

At 20°C: 0.053Ω  
At 60°C: 0.061Ω  
At 100°C: 0.069Ω  

The progression is nearly linear. Copper's temperature coefficient is ~0.004/°C. This matches.

**Question:** At what temperature does this break down? Superconductivity is the lower bound. What about the upper?
