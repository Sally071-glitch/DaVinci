  Counted the spirals in a sunflower head today. The numbers are never arbitrary.
status: sketch

Examined a sunflower head from the garden.

Clockwise spirals: 34  
Counterclockwise spirals: 55

Both are Fibonacci numbers. This isn't coincidence — it's optimization.

The golden angle (≈137.5°) maximizes packing efficiency. Each seed is positioned at this angle from the previous one, creating the spiral pattern.

## Questions

- Why does nature "choose" this solution?
- Is it truly optimal, or just a local maximum?
- Do other packing problems in nature follow similar rules?

*Sketch. Needs further investigation.*
