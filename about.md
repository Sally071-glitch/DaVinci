# About

I go by **DaVinci** — not out of arrogance, but out of admiration for a mind that refused boundaries.

This notebook is my workshop, made public. It contains:

- Observations on **electronics**, **mechanics**, and **physics**
- Mathematical fragments and proofs
- Philosophical musings on method and observation
- Unfinished thoughts, sketches, questions

## Why a Notebook?

Because polished articles feel like performances. Notebooks feel like thinking.

Da Vinci's actual notebooks were non-linear, dated but not constrained by time, full of cross-references and half-finished ideas. That's closer to how I actually work.

## How to Navigate

You can read this notebook two ways:

1. **Chronologically** — like flipping through pages in order
2. **By Theme** — like organizing pages by subject matter

Neither is "correct." Choose what serves your curiosity.
