# About

Hi I am DaVinci and this is **Errata**

## What is Errata about a ?

This is a working notebook.
It contains ideas about circuits, control systems, vehicle dynamics, firmware, and things that didn’t behave the way they were supposed to.
Some entries are finished.
Most are not.
If it works, it will be explained.
If it fails, it will probably be explained better.

## How to Navigate

You can browse through codex in two ways:

1. **Chronologically** — like flipping through pages in order
2. **By Theme** — like organizing pages by subject matter

Neither is "correct." Choose what serves your curiosity.
