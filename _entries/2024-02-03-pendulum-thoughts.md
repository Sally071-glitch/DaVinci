  A pendulum's period is independent of its amplitude (within small angles).
  But why? Geometry reveals what algebra obscures.

Hung a 1kg mass on a 1m string. Measured period at various displacements:

- 5° displacement: T = 2.01s
- 15° displacement: T = 2.02s
- 30° displacement: T = 2.09s

For small angles, the period is essentially constant. The formula T = 2π√(L/g) holds.

## The Geometric Insight

The restoring force is proportional to sin(θ). For small θ, sin(θ) ≈ θ.

This linear approximation is what makes the motion harmonic. When θ grows large, sin(θ) deviates from θ, and we see the period lengthen.

## Cross-reference

This relates to my earlier work on simple harmonic motion in springs. Both systems exhibit the same mathematical structure when operating in their linear regimes.
