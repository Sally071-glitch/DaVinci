Precision: hitting the same spot repeatedly.  
Accuracy: hitting the correct spot.

You can be precise without being accurate. A miscalibrated instrument will give you the wrong answer, consistently.

You can be accurate without being precise. A rough estimate might center on truth even if it wobbles.

**The question:** In science, which matters more? In engineering? In life?
